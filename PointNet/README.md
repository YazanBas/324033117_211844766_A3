# PointNet setup

Place the following files here (not included in repo):

- `pointnet-shapenet-dataset.ipynb` -> `PointNet/pointnet-shapenet-dataset.ipynb`
- ShapeNet core segmentation dataset -> `PointNet/shapenet-core-seg/...`
- Utility scripts -> `PointNet/lidar-od-scripts/...`

Once the notebook is present, update its dataset/script paths to:

- `PointNet/shapenet-core-seg/`
- `PointNet/lidar-od-scripts/`

Suggested Python 3.10.x libs: `numpy`, `torch`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `tqdm`.
